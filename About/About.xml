[h1] Age Morphosis Cells [/h1]
Add a new building, the age morphosis cell, which is kind of similar to a cryptosleep casket. When a pawn enters into it, the device will make it aging faster. You can parameter the aging rate from the mod settings menu. The building requires power to work.

This mod does not belong to me (Haecriver), it belongs to TheSleeplessSorclock, a modder from the modding site that shall not be named. It had never been uploaded to the steam workshop yet, so I cleaned it, updated it and relased it here.
